## 🧩 Terprint Offers (Marketplace Import)

To display concise, actionable summaries of Terprint marketplace products:

1. Generate offers from your marketplace repo.

```bash
npm run import:terprint "C:\\Users\\JamiesonGill\\Documents\\GitHub\\Acidni-LLC\\acidni-publisher-portal\\marketplace-offers\\offers"
```

2. The script writes a compact module to:

- `src/lib/terprint-offers.generated.ts`

3. Pages automatically use the generated data. If the generated file is empty, the site falls back to manual defaults in `src/lib/terprint-offers.ts`.

4. Visit:

- `/products/terprint/offers` for the index
- `/products/terprint/offers/<slug>` for details

Fields shown: name, tagline, summary, features (up to 6), pricing (up to 4), audience, and CTAs (Azure Marketplace, Demo, Docs, Contact).

Note: You can rerun the import anytime as listings evolve.
